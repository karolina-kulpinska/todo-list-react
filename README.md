## ⚙️ Core Technology Stack

This project is a React application powered by modern state management and data storage solutions. It's robust, fast, and scalable.

| Technology | Why We Used It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React.js** | For building a snappy, component-based user interface. |
| **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** | This is the engine! It manages the entire application state (all your tasks) in a predictable way. No more tangled local state! |
| **Styled Components** | For writing clean, modular CSS directly within our JavaScript components. |
